      <h1>Couscous Salad with Peas and Mint</h1>
      <p>
        This is barely a “recipe” since I just threw it together and didn't pay
        much attention to measurements. But it turned out to be pretty tasty, so
        I thought I'd share. It's not the kind of thing where exact <br />
        measurements are that crucial anyway, so use your best judgment and
        personal taste.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="#">1 package couscous</a></li>

            vegetarian)</a

        <li>
          <a href="#"
            >about 1/2 cup fresh mint, chopped (it's gotta be fresh, not
            dried)</a
          >
        </li>
        <li><a href="#">juice of 1 lemon</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">approx. 1/4 cup olive oil (or to taste)</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">1 t. salt</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">fresh ground pepper to taste</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>1. Make whole box of couscous according to the directions, only use chicken broth instead of water. A typical can of broth will be just short of the amount of liquid it calls for on the box, so top it <br> off with water. It will be done in 6 or 7 minutes. Allow to cool (putting it in the fridge speeds it up). <br>
        2. Meanwhile, toss the shelled fresh peas into a pot of boiling water and cook them about 3 minutes, until bright green and tender, but not mushy. Test after 2 minutes to make sure they're not <br> overcooked. Rinse in cold water and allow to cool. <br>
        3. Slice the scallions, chop the mint, toast the pinenuts, and prepare any other veggies you want to toss in there <br>
        4. Make the dressing in a small bowl by whisking together the juice of a lemon, the salt, pepper, and enough olive oil to properly balance the acidity of the lemon juice. It will take <br> approximately 1/4 cup of olive oil, maybe a little more. Remember that this dressing has to flavor many cups of bland and absorbant couscous, so make sure you have enough and make sure the flavor is bold <br> (don't be afraid of the salt... it will get spread out). <br>
        5. When the couscous is cool, toss in the peas, mint, veggies and coat with the dressing. It can be served right away or saved until the next day. <br>
