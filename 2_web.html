      <p>
        The recipe s listed here are one that i have develop myself. In some
        case, I start with a recipes found in a cookbook or magazin, but over
        time, i've adapted it enough to call it my own. <br />
        <i>Bon Appetit</i>

        The site also includes links to my favorite online cooking resouces. One
        day, i hope to include a setion of resturants reviews.
